# when run, this starts GitHub Actions workflow in another repo (GSAS-II-buildtools)

# 1) note that the GitHub Actions to be run must be on: repository_dispatch:
# 2) in the organizaion owning the remote repo, one must create a Personal Access Token
#    (Org level) (Settings/Developer Settings/Personal Access Settings->Tokens
#    got this to work w/classic having this access allowed: 
#     repo:status, repo_deployment, public_repo, repo:invite, security_events, manage_runners:org
#    better w/new style token, I guess
# 3) save the created token in @ project-level: Settings/Secrets and vars/Actions: Repo secret

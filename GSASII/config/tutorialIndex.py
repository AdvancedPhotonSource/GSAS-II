"""A catalog of GSAS-II tutorials with headings. This is the master list
of GSAS-II tutorials and must be updated when tutorials are added.
Each item has either one or three items. Titles are single item in a
list or tuple. Tutorials have four items:

     (a) the name of the directory,
     (b) the name of the web page,
     (c) a title for the tutorial and
     (d) a short text description (optional).

Tutorials that depend on a previous tutorial being completed should
have the title for the tutorial indented by five spaces.

Note that :data:`GSASIIpath.tutorialCatalog` is generated from this table using the
`makeGitTutorial.py` script (see
https://gsas-ii.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GSASIIscripts.html#other-scripts) in the
GSAS-II tutorials repo (https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II-tutorials) and
which creates the tutorials.html file in that repo.

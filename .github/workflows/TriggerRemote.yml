# when run, this starts GitHub Actions workflow in another repo (GSAS-II-buildtools)

# 1) This will trigger all GitHub Actions in workflows that has
#           on: repository_dispatch:
# 2) an authorized user (Brian, or perhaps organization) creates a
#    personal access token.
#  Do this by clicking on "picture (upper rt) 
#     then "Settings" in drop-down and 
#     then select "Developer settings" (at bottom). 
#     Finally select "Fine-grained tokens"
#  Personal access token settings:
#     select owner: APS;
#     select APS/G2-bld;
#     Repo permissions: contents r/w & metadata: r/o.
# 3) Save the created token in this (G2) project. 
#     Use repo-level settings on 2nd line from top (may be in ... menu). 
#     Select Actions in Secrets & variables and create a repository secret. 
#     Name assigned must match ${{ secrets.XXX }} in workflow's curl 
#     call ("Authorization:" setting)

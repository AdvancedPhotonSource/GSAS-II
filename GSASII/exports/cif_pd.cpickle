This R factor may be specified using\n               _refine_ls_R_I_factor. (Some authors report\n               _refine_ls_R_Fsqd_factor or _refine_ls_R_factor_all\n               as the Rietveld or Bragg R factor. While it is appropriate\n               to compute and report any or all of these R factors,\n               the names "Rietveld or Bragg R factor" refer strictly to\n               _refine_ls_R_I_factor.)\n\n              _pd_proc_ls_prof_R_factor, often called R~p~, is an\n                unweighted fitness metric for the agreement between the\n                observed and computed diffraction patterns.\n                   R~p~ = sum~i~ | I~obs~(i) - I~calc~(i) |\n                          / sum~i~ ( I~obs~(i) )\n              _pd_proc_ls_prof_wR_factor, often called R~wp~, is a\n                weighted fitness metric for the agreement between the\n                observed and computed diffraction patterns.\n                  R~wp~ = SQRT {\n                           sum~i~ ( w(i) [ I~obs~(i) - I~calc~(i) ]^2^ )\n                           / sum~i~ ( w(i) [I~obs~(i)]^2^ ) }\n\n              _pd_proc_ls_prof_wR_expected, sometimes called the\n                theoretical R~wp~ or R~exp~, is a weighted fitness metric for\n                the statistical precision of the data set. For an idealized fit,\n                where all deviations between the observed intensities and\n                those computed from the model are due to statistical\n                fluctuations, the observed R~wp~ should match the expected\n                R factor.

S'              This section contains information relevant to the instrument\n               used for the diffraction measurement. For most laboratories,\n               very little of this information will change, so a standard file\n               may be prepared and included with each data set.\n\n               Note that several definitions in the core CIF dictionary\n               are relevant here. For example, use:\n                 _diffrn_radiation_wavelength for the source wavelength,\n                 _diffrn_radiation_type for the X-ray wavelength type,\n                 _diffrn_source for the radiation source,\n                 _diffrn_radiation_polarisn_ratio for the source polarization,\n                 _diffrn_radiation_probe for the radiation type.\n               For data sets measured with partially monochromatized radiation,\n               for example, where both K\\a~1~ and K\\a~2~ are present, it is\n               important that all wavelengths present are included in a\n               loop_ using _diffrn_radiation_wavelength to define the \n               wavelength and _diffrn_radiation_wavelength_wt to define the \n               relative intensity of that wavelength. It is required that \n               _diffrn_radiation_wavelength_id also be present in the \n               wavelength loop. It may also be useful to\n               create a "dummy" ID to use for labelling\n               peaks/reflections where the K\\a~1~ and K\\a~2~ wavelengths are\n               not resolved. Set _diffrn_radiation_wavelength_wt to be 0 for\n               such a dummy ID.\n\n               In the _pd_instr_ definitions, the term monochromator refers\n               to a primary beam (pre-specimen) monochromator and the term\n               analyser refers to post-diffraction (post-specimen)\n               monochromator.  The analyser may be fixed for specific\n               wavelength or may be capable of being scanned.\n\n               For multiple-detector instruments it may be necessary to loop the\n               *_anal/detc or *_spec/detc values (for  _pd_instr_dist_,\n               _pd_instr_divg_, _pd_instr_slit_ and  _pd_instr_soller_) with\n               the detector ID\'s (_pd_calib_detector_id).\n\n               It is strongly recommended that the core dictionary term\n               _diffrn_radiation_probe (specifying the nature of the radiation\n               used) is employed for all data sets.'

It will\n                               usually match the name of the phase\n                               and possibly the name of the current CIF\n                               data block (i.e. the string xxxx in a\n                               data_xxxx identifier). It may be a sample name.\n\n                <creator_name> is the name of the person who measured the\n                               diffractogram, or prepared or modified the CIF.\n\n                <instr_name>  is a unique name (as far as possible) for\n                               the data-collection instrument, preferably\n                               containing the instrument serial number for\n                               commercial instruments. It is also possible to\n                               use the Internet name or address for the\n                               instrument computer as a unique name.\n\n               As blocks are created in a CIF, the original sample identifier\n               (i.e. <block_name>) should be retained, but the <creator_name>\n               may be changed and the <date-time> will always change.\n               The <date-time> will usually match either the\n               _pd_meas_datetime_initiated or the _pd_proc_info_datetime\n               entry.\n\n               Within each section of the code, the following characters\n               may be used:\n                             A-Z a-z 0-9 # & * . : , - _ + / ( ) \\ [ ]\n\n               The sections are separated with vertical rules '|' which are\n               not allowed within the sections. Blank spaces may also\n               not be used.  Capitalization may be used within the ID code\n               but should not be considered significant - searches for\n               data-set ID names should be case-insensitive.\n\n               Date-time entries are in the standard CIF format\n               'yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss+zz' Use of seconds and a time zone\n               is optional, but use of hours and minutes is strongly\n               encouraged as this will help ensure that the ID code is unique.\n\n               An archive site that wishes to make CIFs available via\n               the web may substitute the URL for the file containing the\n               appropriate block for the final two sections of the ID\n               (<creator_name> and <instr_name>).
